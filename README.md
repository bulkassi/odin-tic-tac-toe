# odin-tic-tac-toe

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum. It involved creating a functioning Tic Tac Toe game page with ability to reset the board and change players names. The development of this project involved utilizing (as suggested by the curriculum) factory functions and the IIFE module pattern for incapsulating the game and screen controlling logic and organising the code into structured modules (e.g. player, gameboard and screen controllers). During the development, the material about the `dialog` and `form` elements was revised and used for creating the form for changing players' names alongside some other material learned during the curriculum.
